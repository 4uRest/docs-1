## Application directory


### How to get to the management console directory

Send:

1. Application name 
2. Short description up to six words
3. A logo sized **512 x 512 px** , with an opaque background (iOS style)
4. Application description. It can contain such tags as `h`, `p`, `div`, `b`, `ul`, `i`.
5. The application screenshots, with no drop shadows. If the application is inside the Poster interface, the screenshot should include the entire page.
6. Instructions for using the application
7. The developer contacts, such as phone number and email

### How to get to the directory on the website

Unlike the application page in the management console, the website has a header with a slogan and description. For the publication send:

1. The slogan of your service.
2. Short description. Tell us how useful your service is to the owner of a restaurant or cafe.
3. Gradient or image for the header background.

### Testing

Before publishing, we test the application for functionality. If you need to log in to an external service for testing, send us your login and password.
