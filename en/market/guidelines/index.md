## POS Application

Applications in Poster are used by floor-section employees on devices with touch displays. The operation speed is very important in the work of any restaurant. The faster the waiter interacts with the cash solution, the more time he can devote to communication and building relationships with customers. Several rules for developing applications for Poster follow from this:

1. **Large interface elements.** The waiter works with the app quickly and does not have to spend time aiming for the button. We recommend that you do not create interface elements with a clickable area less than 44 Ã— 44 pixels.
2. **User-friendly interworking scenarios.** Simplify the logic of your app, reduce the number of operations that users have to make to get the result.
3. **Quick operation and feedback.** The application should not freeze; users should at any time understand what is going on.
4. **A small size of the bundle.** Involve utility when adding external libraries so as not to enlarge your bundle file. A large bundle will affect the app launching speed, especially at locations with a slow Internet connection.
