# Introduction

You can create any applications on the Poster platform, for example:

- **Synchronization of orders and products between Poster and your website**. You can use the online orders API to send orders from the website to the register. The location cashier will process and accept an order, and all reports will be available in Poster. 
- **Special reports in the management console**. If you need more options than Poster can offer, you can create an application that is built into the management console and adds functionality to it. You do not need to switch different websites—you have all in one place. 
- **A chat with the floor section employees**. The owner writes in the management console about an incentive program updates and the location news. The message comes to the register; every cashier should check it out.

### Platform Functionality

- **Make API requests.** You can get any data from a Poster account, create products, dishes, and 
- **Embed an application in a POS register.** The platform allows you to create add-in programs for waiters and location employees
- **Embed in the management console.** You can add the functionality to the Poster back office by embedding your application directly into the management console. 

## Getting started

If you write an application for yourself only or explore the platform, use a Personal Integration token in your account in the Access → Integrations section.

If you write an application for Poster customers, you need to create a **Poster app**. **Poster app** is a Poster application profile. 
You will use it to work in the system through and will be able to publish and sell your application in our [Marketplace](#part-d79420499e308168).
