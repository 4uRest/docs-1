## Application deploy

After you finish developing your application, you have to send the app bundle to Poster Marketplace. 
To do this, use `npm run deploy` command in our POS platform boilerplate.

After uploading the bundle, the new application version becomes instantly available to customers. 
It will automatically update when you restart your register application.
