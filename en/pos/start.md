## Getting started

1. Clone a repository from [boilerplate](https://github.com/joinposter/pos-platform-boilerplate) and go to it in the command line.
2. Edit manifest.json, write `applicationId` and `applicationSecret`. If you do not have keys, contact the [customer support](https://joinposter.com/support). 
3. Run `npm install`. 
4. Run `npm run dev`. 
5. Go to the web version of the cash solution in your account: `{account}.joinposter.com/pos` (login and password you have specified during registration; the standard waiter pin is 0000)
6. Open an order and try to pay it. The application will show a popup with “Hello, world” from Boilerplate before payment.
7. Done! You can develop an application and experiment; the source is at`src/js/app.js`.
