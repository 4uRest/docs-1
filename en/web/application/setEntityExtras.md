Poster has a concept of an entity, for example, a register, the location tables, a customer, a waiter, etc. 
You can use this method to expand information about any entity. 
For example, you write an application on the POS platform; you have to authorize a user and save his token for further requests. 
When you restart your tablet, the token will be deleted from memory, but you can save it in the settings entity. 
Now when the register boots, you can get all the settings by the `settings.getAllSettings` method or in the `Poster.settings.extras` object.
