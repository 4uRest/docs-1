# incomingOrders: Online Orders and Reservation

Methods for working with online orders and reservation.

Online orders are orders sent by external applications to the register. Watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5utm6zK3f2U) about online stores integrating with Poster.

The reservation allows you to reserve a table for a customer for the selected time and duration. Watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEG006wjXg0) to see how Poster reservation works.
